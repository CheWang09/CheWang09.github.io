# Building Knowledge base of Recruitment 
## Abstract
Online employment-oriented service has access to large amounts of text data, and current recommender systems always tend to collect users' operations on the website and focus on these features to satisfy the user's current need. In order to improve the accuracy of recommendations. Constructing a knowledge base through text mining from its text data plays an important role in employment-oriented service to attract users. In this report, we present a case study that builds up a knowledge base that consists of the job's name and associated workplaces, job's name and associated company name, and so on.
